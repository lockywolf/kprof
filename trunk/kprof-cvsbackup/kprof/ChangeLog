	* Each profiler now has custom columns which display
	  information specific to this profiler
	* Improved documentation
	* Improved Function Check support

2001-02-25 Florent Pillet <fpillet@users.sourceforge.net>
	* PalmOS Emulator Profile Results are now supported

2001-02-23 Ben Burton <benb@acm.org>
	* Debian packaging
	* Fixed the kprof.desktop file to add the KProf icon in the menus

2001-02-16 Florent Pillet <fpillet@users.sourceforge.net>
	* added Function Check output parser
	* fixed display of values < 1.0 (was using scientific notation)
	* display number columns right-aligned
	* removed "::" before C function names

2001-02-14 Florent Pillet <fpillet@users.sourceforge.net>
	* added an option to turn C++ template abbreviation ON/OFF
	  (see menu Settings->Abbreviate C++ Templates)
	* added font selection. You can now choose the font used
	  to display the profile results list
	* merged a small parser simplification from
	  Carsten Branitzki <csb@operamail.com>
	* fixed saving/restoring the KProf window size
	* disabled printing until the code is written
	* release 1.1
	
2001-02-13 Florent Pillet <fpillet@users.sourceforge.net>
	* improved the display of method names: if a method name has multiple signatures,
	  we display the arguments. Otherwise, we do not display the arguments in order
	  to produce a more readable display.
	* implemented GraphViz and VCG call-graph export functions.

2001-02-05 Florent Pillet <fpillet@users.sourceforge.net>
	* fixed a crasher when right-clicking a class name in object profile
	* much better class name parsing when complex templates are found in names
	* the flat and hierarchical profile view now display a "simplified" version
	  of the function/method names by replacing template arguments by <...>.
	  You can still see the full template arguments in the Object Profile.
	  I'll add a help balloon later to also display the full name.

2001-01-23 Florent Pillet <florent.pillet@wanadoo.fr>
	* added the documentation template
	* added the call-graph generation UI, with provisions for VCG and GraphViz support.

2001-01-16 Florent Pillet <florent.pillet@wanadoo.fr>

	* new build system again (admin/ scripts are back, they
	  are more tailored for the actual build settings in KDE).
	* binary programs can now be opened. In this case, KProf
	  requires that the result of program execution
	  (the `gmon.out' file) be located in either the current
	  directory or the binary program's directory.
	* new call graph generator: KProf can now generate call
	  graphs for visualization in external graphing programs.
	  Supported output formats are GraphViz, an excellent
	  open source graph visualization program from ATT
	  (http://www.graphviz.org/) and VCG, another free graph
	  visualization tool.

2000-09-10 Florent Pillet <florent.pillet@wanadoo.fr>

	* added Open Recent... menu item
	* fixed a bug in the parser which could skip some functions
	* added some What's This? help items
	* new build system (got rid of KDE2's 600K+ build scripts)
	* the three views are now synchronized (selection occurs simultaneously)
	* moved to KActions for menus and added kprofui.rc

2000-08-27 Bernd Gehrman <bernd@physik.hu-berlin.de>

	* added cprofileinfo.h to Makefile.am
