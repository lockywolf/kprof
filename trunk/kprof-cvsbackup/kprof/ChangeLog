2001-02-13 Florent Pillet <fpillet@users.sourceforge.net>
	* improved the display of method names: if a method name has multiple signatures,
	  we display the arguments. Otherwise, we do not display the arguments in order
	  to produce a more readable display.
	* implemented GraphViz and VCG call-graph export functions.

2001-02-05 Florent Pillet <fpillet@users.sourceforge.net>
	* fixed a crasher when right-clicking a class name in object profile
	* much better class name parsing when complex templates are found in names
	* the flat and hierarchical profile view now display a "simplified" version
	  of the function/method names by replacing template arguments by <...>.
	  You can still see the full template arguments in the Object Profile.
	  I'll add a help balloon later to also display the full name.

2001-01-23 Florent Pillet <florent.pillet@wanadoo.fr>
	* added the documentation template
	* added the call-graph generation UI, with provisions for VCG and GraphViz support.

2001-01-16 Florent Pillet <florent.pillet@wanadoo.fr>

	* new build system again (admin/ scripts are back, they
	  are more tailored for the actual build settings in KDE).
	* binary programs can now be opened. In this case, KProf
	  requires that the result of program execution
	  (the `gmon.out' file) be located in either the current
	  directory or the binary program's directory.
	* new call graph generator: KProf can now generate call
	  graphs for visualization in external graphing programs.
	  Supported output formats are GraphViz, an excellent
	  open source graph visualization program from ATT
	  (http://www.graphviz.org/) and VCG, another free graph
	  visualization tool.
