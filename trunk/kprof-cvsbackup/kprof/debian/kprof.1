.SH NAME
kprof \- a KDE3 visual tool to help analyze profiling results
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kprof
.RI "[ " generic-options " ]"
[ \fB\-f\fP \fIfile\fP ]
[ \fB\-p\fP \fIprofiler\fP ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBKProf\fP is a visual tool for developers that displays the execution
profiling output generated by code profiling tools. The output of gprof being
usually difficult to read (beyond the flat profile information), KProf
presents the information in list- or tree-views that make the execution
profiling information very easy to understand.
.PP
Currently supported profilers include GNU gprof, Function Check and Palm
OS Emulator with profile option.
.SH OPTIONS
Below are the kprof-specific options.
For a full summary of options, run \fIkprof \-\-help\fP.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP \fIfile\fP
Open the given profiling output file.
.TP
\fB\-p\fP \fIprofiler\fP
Specifies which profiler was used to create the profiling output file.
The profiler argument must be one of \fIgprof\fP (GNU gprof),
\fIfnccheck\fP (Function Check) or \fIpose\fP (Palm OS Emulator).
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR gprof (1).
