kprof 1.0
---------

KProf is a tool that lets you examine the output of gprof(1),
a command which allows you to profile a program and dump
information about execution profile.

This version of KProf does not generate the profile reports
it needs to get analysis data. You must first create the
report using:

	gprof -b myprogram > report

Then open the report with KProf.

KProf has only been tested with the output files produced by
GNU gprof 2.9.5. Your mileage may vary.

Feel free to send bugs and patches to florent.pillet@wanadoo.fr

TODO:
-----

* Makefile links the software twice and the second time generates
a binary with KDE & QT functions statically linked. I still have
to figure out what's going on.
