	* new build system again (admin/ scripts are back, they
	  are more tailored for the actual build settings in KDE).

	  requires that the result of program execution
	  (the `gmon.out' file) be located in either the current
	  directory or the binary program's directory.
	* new call graph generator: KProf can now generate call
	  graphs for visualization in external graphing programs.
	  Supported output formats are GraphViz, an excellent
	  open source graph visualization program from ATT

	  visualization tool.
