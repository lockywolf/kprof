kprof 1.0.2
-----------

KProf is a tool that lets you examine the output of gprof(1),
a command which allows you to profile a program and dump
information about execution profile.

You can open two kind of files with KProf:

- a binary program. In this case, KProf will try to locate a
  file named `gmon.out' in the same directory. This file is
  generated automatically when a program compiled with
  profiling turned on is executed.

- a text profile results generated by `gprof' after the
  binary program has been executed and the `gmon.out' file
  has been created as a result of the execution. To create
  the text profile results file, do the following:

	$ gprof -b myprogram > results.txt

  Then open the `results.txt' file with KProf.


KProf has only been tested with the output files produced by
GNU gprof 2.9.5 and up. Your mileage may vary if you are using
an earlier version.
