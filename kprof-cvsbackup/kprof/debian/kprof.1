.SH NAME
kprof \- a KDE3 visual tool to help analyze profiling results
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B kprof
.RI "[ " generic-options " ]"
.RI "[ " file " ]"
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B kprof
command.
This manual page was written for the Debian GNU/Linux distribution
because the original program does not have a manual page.
.PP
\fBKProf\fP is a visual tool for developers that displays the execution
profiling output generated by code profiling tools. The output of gprof being
usually difficult to read (beyond the flat profile information), KProf
presents the information in list- or tree-views that make the execution
profiling information very easy to understand.
.PP
Currently supported profilers include GNU gprof, Function Check and Palm
OS Emulator with profile option.
.SH OPTIONS
For a full summary of options, run \fIkprof \-\-help\fP.
