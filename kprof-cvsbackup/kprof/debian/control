Description: a KDE3 visual tool to help analyze profiling results
 KProf is a visual tool for developers that displays the execution profiling 
 output generated by code profiling tools.  The output of gprof being usually
 difficult to read (beyond the flat profile information), KProf presents
 the information in list- or tree-views that make the execution profiling
 information very easy to understand.
 .
 Currently supported profilers include GNU gprof, Function Check and
 Palm OS Emulator with profile option.
